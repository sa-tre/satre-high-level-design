# TRE Actors and Roles

Drawing from a number of sources we can create a consolidated list of system actors and roles they 
can take in working with TREs. Different [TRE archetypes]() can have different relationships between
these roles, but the roles themselves are consistent across all archetypes.

As an example, a Data Manager role may be taken by an Information Governance actor, or in other archetypes
may be delegated or otherwise assigned to a Project Principal Investigator.
